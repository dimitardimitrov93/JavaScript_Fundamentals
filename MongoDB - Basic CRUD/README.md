A lecture from the Technology Fundamentals with JS Course held in January 2019. The lecture aims to introduce **MongoDB** and the **CRUD operations** that can be performed with the DB as well as the **Mongoose ORM** and the interaction between Node JS and MongoDB. The lecturer Ivaylo Papazov also demonstrates how to use GUI's to work with MongoDB, such as:

**Robo 3T**
**Compass**

The lecture also examines how to implement MongoDB with **Node JS** and create an application with the **MVC pattern**.

The application is an online product store and can perform the following actions:

Create Product ==> creates a document in the DB;
Edit Product ==> finds the product by ID in the DB and Updates its data;
Delete Product ==> finds the product by ID in the DB and Deletes it;
